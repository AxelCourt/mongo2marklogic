MarkLogic XML Contentbase Connector for Java (XCC/J) version 6.0-2

This distribution contains code and basic documentation for XCC/J.

The directory structure is organized as follows:

lib/
	This directory contains two jar files.

	marklogic-xcc-6.0.2.jar: This is the XCC/J distribution and 
	contains all the classes you need to use XCC/J.  The minimum 
	supported Java distribution version is JDK 1.5.

	marklogic-xcc-examples-6.0.2.jar: This jar contains compiled 
	example classes.  The source files for these classes are under 
	the "src" directory.

src/
	This directory contains source for the classes in the
	com.marklogic.xcc.examples package.  These sources are
	also included in the Javadoc bundle for convenience.

docs/
	This directory contains the API documentation (Javadoc).
	They are included in two forms:

	xcc_apidocs.zip: A zip archive of the full Javadocs.
	Use this zip file if you wish to place the Javadocs
	on a central web server, for example.

	api/: The contents of the above zip file, expanded
	for local browsing.  Point your web browser at the
	file "docs/api/index.html" to read the API docs.

	Additional XCC documentation, including a Developer's
	Guide, can be found on the MarkLogic developer website:
